## Description

>  This app is a fun "burger logger" that uses the MVC design pattern with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

> As a burger lover
> I want an app that lists my favorite burgers 
> so that I can track which wants I have devoured
